print(a // b) #division withiut floating points 
print(a / b) # division with floating points( ex 0.0939)
print(a % b) #modulo (remainder)
print(a * b) # multiplication 
print(a ** b) # squaring 
# these are some arithmetic operators in python
# there are some built in functions in python like math which we can use "import" to make arithmetic operations easily
