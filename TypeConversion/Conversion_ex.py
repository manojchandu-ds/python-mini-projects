#Type Conversion is nothing but converting one data type value into another data type value
a = "12345789"
b = int(a)
print(b)
#This can covert the string of numbers into integer of numbers 
a = 1985.54
b = int(a)
print(b)
#It converts float to integers
a = 21
b = float(a)
print(b)
#Converts int to float
a = 354
b = str(a)
print(b)
#converts int to str 

#So this are the examples of type conversions in python...🙌
