#loops are two types one is while loop and another one is for loop in python 

#loops are useful to repeat a code several time 
#first lets get in to the while loop
i = 0  #initilization
while i <= 3: #Termination_condition (loops until the condition is true)
  print(i)  # A piece of code
  i = i + 1  # updation (if u miss this, then welocome to the looop that never ends)

#for loop 
for i in range(1,10):  #we use range function in for loop to print number (1,10) prints number from 1 to 9 
  print(i)
# we can also use for loop to itetate over a string by taking each character
words = manoj
for word in words:
  print(word)
  # this code will iterate through each character in a string words "manoj"....
